# Data Science and Machine Learning (updating)

This repository contains two excellent courses. I knit it in the same repo because they are both Machine Learning courses.  
- INDE577-Data Science and Machine Learning. Offered by Rice University. Instructor: Dr. Randy R. Davila.   [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/c/drrandydavila)
- ML Specialization. Offered by Stanford University.   Instructor: Dr. Andrew Ng.    [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction?utm_medium=sem&utm_source=gg&utm_campaign=B2C_NAMER_machine-learning-introduction_stanford_FTCOF_specializations_country-US&campaignid=685340575&adgroupid=146515176429&device=c&keyword=&matchtype=&network=g&devicemodel=&adposition=&creativeid=650958766230&hide_mobile_promo&gclid=Cj0KCQjwiZqhBhCJARIsACHHEH9nwJVzEpaVfK2pcMPZfVVcVQuOmHyVZQU0ldwW-6g3w31bffWwYKMaAiX6EALw_wcB)
